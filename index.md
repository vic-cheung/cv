__GRADUATE RESEARCHER IN SINGLE-CELL OMICS, SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE__, *[Evan Feinberg Lab](http://www.evanfeinberglab.com/who-we-are) @ [UCSF](https://tetrad.ucsf.edu/)*<br>
__Project 1__<br>
Developed a multiplexed, high-throughput, single-cell sequencing method for neurons that preserve connectivity information in addition to obtaining molecular identity (VECTORseq). Git Repo [here](https://github.com/vic-cheung/vectorseq).<br>
<p>Wrote the data processing pipeline using Python after genome alignment using Cellranger (10x Genomics) on an AWS EC2 instance. Used unsupervised machine learning techniques such as t-SNE/UMAP clustering to match molecular identities to cellular function and role in behavioral output. Implemented nearest neighbors algorithms to account for batch differences when merging datasets. Streamlined brain dissociation techniques and increased neuron survivability yield 100-fold based on data-driven outcomes from clustering analyses. Validated clustering results of single-cell sequencing against the [2020 10x sequencing dataset from the Allen Atlas](https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/mouse-whole-cortex-and-hippocampus-10x) and that the methodology was functional. Evaluated range of highly variable genes expressed per cluster for the validation of cell identity. Managed collaborations with the Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub (Spyros Darmanis Group, now @ Genentech).</p>

__HEALTH DATA SCIENCE FELLOW__, *[Insight Data Science](https://insightfellows.com/health-data) @Silicon Valley*<br>
<p>Developed a predictive clinical calculator to assess Acute Kidney Injury in hospitalized patients, which would result in better management, care/medication dosing, injury prevention, and reduced hospital length of stay, thus freeing up occupied resources and minimizing financial costs to both patient and hospital. Utilized PostgreSQL querying to gather relevant data from the MIMIC-III database and manipulated the data with Python Pandas from 25 tables of data, 46,000 patients, thousands of diagnoses and lab tests, and clinical documentation-- generating over 3 million rows of data and 70 unique features comprising lab tests and demographic information. Used supervised machine learning in Python such as regression models from scikit-learn and XGBoost to forecast Acute Kidney Injury, with a predictive accuracy of ~91%.
